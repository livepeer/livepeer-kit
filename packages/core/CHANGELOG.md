  The timeout for playback can be customized with `webrtcConfig.canPlayTimeout`:

  ```tsx
  import { Player, WebRTCVideoConfig } from '@livepeer/react';

  const webrtcConfig: WebRTCVideoConfig = {
    canPlayTimeout: 8000,
  };

  const Page = () => {
    return <Player playbackId={playbackId} webrtcConfig={webrtcConfig} />;
  };

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- [#394](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/394) [`5d5048d`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/5d5048d4854c55f8f452ce969d2adcaf4c5b5dc3) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** updated clipping to include an optional session ID.

## 1.8.7

### Patch Changes

- [#386](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/386) [`1dc5657`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/1dc56579028acafcdcb5c45a79fed34855bad1d3) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added constant to WebRTCConfig to allow constant playback speed in the Player, and prevent audio distortion.

  Also added a callback for when these errors occur: `onPlaybackError`. This can be used like:

  ```tsx
  onPlaybackError={(e) => {
    if (e === null) {
      doSomethingWithErrorResolved();
    } else if (e?.type === 'offline') {
      doSomethingWithOfflineError();
    }
  }}
  ```

## 1.8.5

### Patch Changes

- [`17f84fd`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/17f84fd5dc9091555e240f45c0c54ae90b9e5a3d) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** bumping version due to intermittent release error.

## 1.8.4

### Patch Changes

- [#376](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/376) [`3301827`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/33018273c81b6a0482ce1cbb9441b7a1f100bf46) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed to have a cleaner fallback for 406 response from WebRTC negotiation.

## 1.8.3

### Patch Changes

- [#374](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/374) [`5cbf402`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/5cbf4021ce3771d52bc69f2667f1431f6238e44d) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed the fallback when b-frames exist to not show a playback error until HLS has been attempted.

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- [`d809f28`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/d809f28ea71dd0317ae57973a4f85c5d65ad5d0a) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** added changes to strip a non-standard port number from the WebRTC redirect host, if present.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#370](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/370) [`269d3a3`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/269d3a3f37845ea643e3c4f281de62347529b988) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fix for TTFF reporting, to measure the difference between the `play` event and the first progress update.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#364](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/364) [`37c97e7`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/37c97e7cfce433e95cb790965acfd069634e66bd) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added `lowLatency` option of `force` - this requires WebRTC to be used, if a WebRTC playback source exists (which is only for livestreams). It disables the automatic fallback to HLS.

  Fixed issue when `lowLatency` is `true` where it would immediately fall back to HLS - it should now retry if the stream is offline, and fall back to HLS only when there is an unknown error (this could be a variety of causes - intermittent network issues, browser failure, etc).

  The default `lowLatency` option is now `true` - to opt out of low latency, pass `lowLatency=false` to the Player or the lvpr.tv search params.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#362](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/362) [`5c905ce`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/5c905cea6d4375a42403fe0eb95b6e522832741b) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Chore:** update downstream packages and changed the default icon for microphone mute/unmute in `<Broadcast />`.

  Package updates include:

### Patch Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/358) [`50551ce`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/50551cebf04ff64307c95fdce3119ce29dae695b) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added `renderChildrenOutsideContainer` to both Broadcast and Player, which determines whether the children should be rendered outside of the aspect ratio container.

  `useMediaController` without any parent elements.

  Also added `onPlaybackStatusUpdate`, which is a callback that is called when the broadcast status updates.
  **This should be used with `playbackStatusSelector` to limit state updates.**

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#336](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/336) [`effc06b`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/effc06bd2c578ca1a4688108062badd9f6a9c802) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed TTFF bug with the Player reporting an inaccurate TTFF when `priority` was used with a Player which is below the fold. This was happening on the lvpr.tv player, since it is always set to `priority` even though the Player can be below the fold.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#334](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/334) [`8cd5537`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/8cd5537fd19e585cb69c9c1f7fb775a76fae9f25) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** added a prop, `lowLatency`, to the Player, to allow for opting-in to low latency WebRTC.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#314](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/314) [`49c4c99`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/49c4c99f9b044afc37072517db8eda1d94b4c377) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** Added WebRTC playback for the web Player, which uses the new endpoint from the Studio provider to play back WebRTC livestreams, if they are available. If these do not succeed in playing back, the Player will automatically fall back to HLS playback. Also, if the stream contains "bframes" (which are common for users streaming with OBS or other streaming providers), the Player will automatically fall back.

We currently only support `unverified` types, which means that passing a verified signature to verify the address is not yet possible.

  ```tsx
  type CreateAssetCreatorId =
    | {
        /**
         * The `type` of the identifier - unverified means that the value is not signed, and is an address
         * that is blindly trusted.
         */
        type: 'unverified';
        /**
         * Developer-managed ID of the user who created the asset.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#267](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/pull/267) [`85e4c05`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-react/commit/85e4c0563802d737bda5d2b76cd36e069da1c61c) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added MP4 rendition prioritization to the React and React Native Player.

  This is for support of MP4 renditions returned from `playbackInfo` from the Studio provider. If an MP4 rendition exists for an Asset, it will be prioritized over HLS, since this has been introduced as a performance improvement over HLS for short-form video.

  The MP4 renditions will be chosen with the following algorithm: the device screen width and multiplied by a static multiplier (currently set to x2.5). This value is then compared to the rendition widths, and the renditions are prioritized based on the distance between these values. This results in a choice of a rendition which is close to the screen size without visual quality issues. For instance, a device with a 1280 pixel width would compute `1280px * 2.5 = 3200px`, and then sort the MP4 renditions by which are closest to this value.
