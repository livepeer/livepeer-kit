## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- [#342](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/342) [`e36b570`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/e36b57025246682d1396226fadf665cf12afed86) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed [Safari not emitting `canplay` event](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/issues/1686) with autoplay disabled, and replaced this event with `loadedmetadata` to know when the video is ready for playback.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- [#340](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/340) [`99321fb`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/99321fb44e130c89fa6e2a0f24082d8a88df9bf7) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed WebRTC playback on Safari and removed redundant `HEAD` request in SDP negotiation.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- [#338](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/338) [`8efce52`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/8efce520a6c5f1c240356360671a434088cab7dd) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added `creatorId` to useCreateStream, useUpdateStream, and useUpdateAsset.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#336](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/336) [`effc06b`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/effc06bd2c578ca1a4688108062badd9f6a9c802) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed TTFF bug with the Player reporting an inaccurate TTFF when `priority` was used with a Player which is below the fold. This was happening on the lvpr.tv player, since it is always set to `priority` even though the Player can be below the fold.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#334](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/334) [`8cd5537`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/8cd5537fd19e585cb69c9c1f7fb775a76fae9f25) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** added a prop, `lowLatency`, to the Player, to allow for opting-in to low latency WebRTC.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#314](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/314) [`49c4c99`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/49c4c99f9b044afc37072517db8eda1d94b4c377) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** Added WebRTC playback for the web Player, which uses the new endpoint from the Studio provider to play back WebRTC livestreams, if they are available. If these do not succeed in playing back, the Player will automatically fall back to HLS playback. Also, if the stream contains "bframes" (which are common for users streaming with OBS or other streaming providers), the Player will automatically fall back.

We currently only support `unverified` types, which means that passing a verified signature to verify the address is not yet possible.

  ```tsx
  type CreateAssetCreatorId =
    | {
        /**
         * The `type` of the identifier - unverified means that the value is not signed, and is an address
         * that is blindly trusted.
         */
        type: 'unverified';
        /**
         * Developer-managed ID of the user who created the asset.
         */
        value: string;
      }

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#299](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/299) [`ec96b12`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/ec96b12243b3688ddff9a55db1a03454d0af0e25) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added `accessKey` and `onAccessKeyRequest` props to the Player, to support the `webhook` playback policy which allows users to play back streams/assets with webhook authentication. The access key is appended to the query string in the source URL of the video, and this access key is passed along to a user-defined webhook which validates the payload to make sure the user has access to the content.

### Patch Changes

- [#303](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/303) [`8f65da8`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/8f65da8771771629da6c9fa5a55cce0447966d32) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** updated the metrics to send the `pageUrl` as the `document.referrer` when used in an iFrame context, to be able to attribute metrics to a page which uses an iFrame.

This works only in certain conditions where the site is considered "trusted" and the user has interacted with the site - see [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/) and [Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/) docs for further details on when this is allowed. We recommend testing on your site to ensure that the media will autoplay under the conditions that you expect the user to engage with your content.

- [#295](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/295) [`3f653f7`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/3f653f716ed03b587389cda330541cb30a5f3b4a) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Fix:** fixed the user agent string to be sanitized before passing to the metrics websocket.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#267](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/267) [`85e4c05`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/85e4c0563802d737bda5d2b76cd36e069da1c61c) Thanks [@0xcadams](https://github.com/0xcadams)! - **Feature:** added MP4 rendition prioritization to the React and React Native Player.

  This is for support of MP4 renditions returned from `playbackInfo` from the Studio provider. If an MP4 rendition exists for an Asset, it will be prioritized over HLS, since this has been introduced as a performance improvement over HLS for short-form video.

  The MP4 renditions will be chosen with the following algorithm: the device screen width and multiplied by a static multiplier (currently set to x2.5). This value is then compared to the rendition widths, and the renditions are prioritized based on the distance between these values. This results in a choice of a rendition which is close to the screen size without visual quality issues. For instance, a device with a 1280 pixel width would compute `1280px * 2.5 = 3200px`, and then sort the MP4 renditions by which are closest to this value.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/pull/240) [`c4cb597`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/commit/c4cb59762a31c865bb8ada9a4176caa614f6be7a) Thanks [@clacladev](https://github.com/clacladev)! - **Fix:** added clearer Player error handling instead of an infinite loading spinner. The Player now shows error states for gated streams which do not have a proper JWT and streams which are currently offline.
