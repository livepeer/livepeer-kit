# Video Player

The example below shows our drop-in video player for easily viewing video content! The example below uses the
[`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer) to view a video asset and [`useMetrics`](/docs/playback/useMetrics) to fetch
viewership data.

<DemoVideoPlayer />

## Step 1: Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with the Studio provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/docs/providers/studio#apikey):

```tsx
import { LivepeerConfig, createReactClient } from '@livepeer/react';
import { studioProvider } from 'livepeer/providers/studio';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

// Pass client to React Context Provider
function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient}>
      <CreateAndViewAsset />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Play Video

Now that our providers are set up, we use the [`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer) with a `playbackId`, which we created
previously when uploading a video asset.

We also show the total view count from [`useMetrics`](/docs/playback/useMetrics)!

```tsx
import { VideoPlayer, useMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const playbackId = 'a4e8o6mykgkvtxav';

export const DemoVideoPlayer = () => {
  const { data: metrics } = useMetrics({ playbackId });

  return (
    <>
      <VideoPlayer playbackId={playbackId} loop muted />

      {metrics?.[0] && <Badge>Views: {metrics?.[0]?.startViews ?? 0}</Badge>}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Wrap Up

That's it! You just used the video player component to easily integrate Livepeer video, with viewership metrics!
