# Video Player

The example below shows our drop-in video player for easily viewing video content! The example below uses the
[`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer) to view a video asset.

<DemoVideoPlayer />

## Step 1: Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with the Studio provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/docs/providers/studio#apikey):

```tsx
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

// Pass client to React Context Provider
function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient}>
      <CreateAndViewAsset />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Play Video

Now that our providers are set up, we use the [`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer) with a `playbackId`, which we created
previously when uploading a video asset.

```tsx
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const playbackId = 'a4e8o6mykgkvtxav';

export const DemoVideoPlayer = () => {
  return <Player playbackId={playbackId} loop muted />;
};
```

## Wrap Up

That's it! You just used the video player component to easily integrate Livepeer video!
