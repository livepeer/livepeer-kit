# Play a Video from IPFS or Arweave

Playing back transcoded video from IPFS or Arweave is easy with livepeer.js! The example below uses the Player's built-in automatic IPFS/Arweave upload to
play back transcoded IPFS/Arweave content without any additional configuration.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **This example illustrates how Livepeer can be used as a video processing and
  caching layer on top of IPFS and Arweave for optimized video playback.** As
  shown below, there are delays when content has never been viewed - the first
  user will need to wait for upload. We recommend, whenever possible, to upload
  via `useCreateAsset` before displaying it in the player.

## Step 1: Configuring Providers

First, we create a new livepeer.js client with the Studio provider and a [CORS-protected API key](/react/providers/studio#apikey):

```tsx
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import * as React from 'react';

const livepeerClient = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
  }),
});

// Pass client to React Context Provider
function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={livepeerClient}>
      <IpfsPlayback />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Automatic Playback

Now that our providers are set up, we can add a text input for an IPFS CID or an IPFS/Arweave URL using `parseCid` and `parseArweaveTxId`
from the core `livepeer` package - _this is only
used for UI purposes, to provide feedback if the user input is valid_.

If the input is valid, we then pass that input to the [`Player`](/react/Player), which automatically detects if it is a valid CID and attempts
to fetch the playback info for that CID. If the provider does not have an `Asset` with that CID, the Player will automatically attempt
to upload the CID from IPFS, and then play the transcoded content back, without any additional code on the frontend.

```tsx
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
import { parseArweaveTxId, parseCid } from 'livepeer/media';

import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

export const DecentralizedStoragePlayback = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState<string>('');

  const idParsed = useMemo(() => parseCid(url) ?? parseArweaveTxId(url), [url]);

  return (
    <>
      <Box>
        <Text>IPFS or Arweave URL</Text>
        <TextField
          type="text"
          placeholder="ipfs://... or ar://"
          onChange={(e) => setUrl(e.target.value)}
        />

        {url && !idParsed && (
          <Text>Provided value is not a valid identifier.</Text>
        )}
      </Box>

      {idParsed && (
        <Player title={idParsed.id} src={url} autoPlay muted autoUrlUpload />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Wrap Up

That's it! You just configured a caching & transcoding layer on top of IPFS and Arweave with a few lines of code!
