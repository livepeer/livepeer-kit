# Contract Addresses

All contract addresses for the Livepeer protocol.

## Addresses

The addresses for the protocol contracts are provided in a simple import with types.

```tsx
import {
  arbitrumOneAddress,
  arbitrumRinkebyAddress,
  mainnetAddress,
  rinkebyAddress,
} from '@livepeer/react';
```

These addresses will be expanded upon in a future version of livepeer.js to include more in-depth contract
interaction.

## Chain IDs

There are exports for the chain IDs the Livepeer protocol is currently deployed on. This includes both
Arbitrum One/mainnet and testnet chains.

```tsx
import { allChainId, mainnetChainId, testnetChainId } from '@livepeer/react';
```
