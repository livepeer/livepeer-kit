# Player

The `Player` component provides an easy way to display video or audio.

```ts
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
```

## Usage

The following example assumes a stream or asset was created via `useCreateAsset` or `useCreateStream`, and the `playbackId`
was passed to the viewer.

<br />

<SimplePlayer />

```tsx
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
import Image from 'next/image';

import blenderPoster from '../../../public/images/blender-poster.png';

const PosterImage = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={blenderPoster}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

export const SimplePlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      poster={<PosterImage />}
      showPipButton
    />
  );
};
```

Here we also introduce a custom `PosterImage` React component, which is described in
more detail below in [`poster`](#poster) configuration.

## Configuration

### playbackId or src

A `playbackId` for an [Asset](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/core/src/types/provider.ts) or
[Stream](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/core/src/types/provider.ts), or `src`, a media source URL. One of these is
required. If a playback ID is provided, it will automatically retrieve the playback URL corresponding to the playback ID.

#### playbackId

```tsx {7}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
    />
  );
}
```

The `playbackId` passed to the `Player` can be either a short playback ID
which is created on asset/stream creation, or, for an asset, an IPFS CID. If
the provided IPFS CID has not been uploaded yet, it will be auto-uploaded and
played back - see [`autoUrlUpload`](#autourlupload) for more details.

```tsx {9}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  // only after the asset has been persisted to IPFS
  // equivalent to the above example
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="bafybeida3w2w7fch2fy6rfvfttqamlcyxgd3ddbf4u25n7fxzvyvcaegxy"
    />
  );
}
```

#### src

The Player also supports an arbitrary `src` URL which can correspond to any common video or audio which most browsers support.
See [caniuse video format](https://caniuse.com/?search=video%20format) for more details. Metrics reporting **will not** work
with an arbitrary `src` that is not a recognized provider (e.g. not a Studio playback URL).

If the `src` is an IPFS URL, it will be auto-uploaded and played back - see [`autoUrlUpload`](#autourlupload) for
more details.

```tsx {7}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

const src =
  'https://ipfs.livepeer.studio/ipfs/QmURv3J5BGsz23GaCUm7oXncm2M9SCj8RQDuFPGzAFSJw8';

function App() {
  return <Player src={src} />;
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Using an arbitrary `src` that is not from a provider will not be transcoded,
  and will take up significant network bandwidth. It's highly recommended to
  upload media to a provider, and serve content to viewers with a `playbackId`
  (which will serve transcoded content).
</Callout>

For example, try viewing/seeking the video below while [simulating a slower network
connection](https://awik.io/simulate-slow-internet-connection-chrome-developer-tools/)
in your browser - it will be _painfully_ slow. Then, check out the [transcoded
version above](#usage) with the exact same network speed.

<Player src="https://ipfs.livepeer.studio/ipfs/QmPHSco6gGRL9WZTjsYeAvqTJkCTNe4VyCbX5SWYaK4h8L/agent-327.mp4" />

### title

The `title` for the content. This is highly recommended, since it is used for [accessibility labels](https://web.dev/semantics-aria/)
in the Player. If you do not want to show the title visually, see [`showTitle`](#showTitle).

```tsx {6}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
    />
  );
}
```

<Player title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop" playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr" />

### showTitle

Enables/disables the title component.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      showTitle={false}
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  showTitle={false}
/>

### aspectRatio

Sets the aspect ratio for the content. Highly recommended for a great viewing experience (see why we want to prevent
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)). Defaults to `16to9`.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      aspectRatio="1to1"
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  aspectRatio="1to1"
/>

### loop

Sets whether the content will loop when finished. Defaults to `false`.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      loop
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  loop
/>

### poster

Sets the poster image. This can be either a string for an image URL, or a React component.

<Callout>
  It is recommended to use an optimized React image component for this, as
  opposed to passing a simple URL.
</Callout>

#### Simple

The `poster` can be a simple image URL, and it will be rendered with a regular `img` HTML tag.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      poster="/images/blender-poster.png"
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  poster="/images/blender-poster.png"
/>

#### Advanced

If the poster is a React component, it will be rendered with similar CSS attributes to the `img` above. In the below example,
we show the use of [Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) to render an optimized
image, which will automatically handle slow network conditions/different device sizes.

```tsx {8-13,22}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
import Image from 'next/image';

import blenderPoster from '../../../public/images/blender-poster.png';

const PosterImage = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={blenderPoster}
      layout="fill"
      objectFit="cover"
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      poster={<PosterImage />}
    />
  );
}
```

<ImagePosterPlayer />

### showLoadingSpinner

Shows/hides the loading spinner for the media content. Defaults to `true`.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      showLoadingSpinner={false}
    />
  );
}
```

### controls

Configures the timeout for autohiding controls, and if keyboard hotkeys for controlling video are enabled.

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      controls={{ autohide: 0, hotkeys: false }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  controls={{ autohide: 0, hotkeys: false }}
/>

### autoPlay and muted

Sets the video to autoplay when the content comes into focus on the webpage. If `autoPlay` is specified, `muted` must also
be present. This is [enforced in many modern browsers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/) and is a requirement for
the Player.

```tsx {8-9}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      muted
      autoPlay
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  muted
  autoPlay
/>

### objectFit

Sets the video's [object fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property. Defaults to `cover` -
`contain` is usually used in full-screen applications or when the `aspectRatio` does not match the content (or there is no
guarantee the `aspectRatio` matches).

```tsx {9}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      aspectRatio="1to1"
      objectFit="contain"
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  aspectRatio="1to1"
  objectFit="contain"
/>

### showPipButton

Shows the Picture-in-Picture button to the left of the fullscreen button. Defaults to `false`.
See [children](#children) for an example on how to use the underlying `<PictureInPictureButton />`.

<Callout emoji="🌐">
  We support both the [w3c](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) standard
  (which most modern browsers support), as well as the [older Safari/iOS
  spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/adding_picture_in_picture_to_your_safari_media_controls).
  See the browsers which support Picture-in-Picture on
  [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/picture-in-picture).
</Callout>

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      showPipButton
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  showPipButton
/>

### autoUrlUpload

Enables automatic upload and playback from decentralized storage providers. Currently supports IPFS CIDs/URLs. Defaults to `false`.

It is highly recommended for the best playback experience to upload from an IPFS URL using `useCreateAsset` (with the format `ipfs://<CID>`)
before presenting the content to the user - the first view with automatic URL upload can take a few minutes, then it will be permanently
cached and play back quickly.

<Callout>
  An IPFS [v0 or v1 CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) or URL (such as `ipfs://<CID>`, `https://<CID>.ipfs.dweb.link/` or
  `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/<CID>`, _but not a directory_) can be passed as the `src` or `playbackID` to the Player, and it will
  automatically detect if it is a valid CID and attempt to fetch the playback info for the CID. If the API does not have an Asset with the corresponding CID,
  the Player will automatically attempt to upload the CID from IPFS, and then play the transcoded content back. This may take a few minutes.
</Callout>

```tsx {8}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="Qmc5rn4Hi8a5JJQdrVAKyeEpCNJnM8t5fhJnoobstVcSFB"
      autoUrlUpload
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="Qmc5rn4Hi8a5JJQdrVAKyeEpCNJnM8t5fhJnoobstVcSFB"
  autoUrlUpload
/>

### theme

Sets the Player-specific theme overrides. It is recommended to use [`LivepeerConfig`](/react/LivepeerConfig) for
any global app styles, and the `theme` prop to override those styles on a per-Player basis.

```tsx {8-24}
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      theme={{
        borderStyles: {
          containerBorderStyle: 'hidden',
        },
        colors: {
          accent: '#00a55f',
        },
        space: {
          controlsBottomMarginX: '10px',
          controlsBottomMarginY: '5px',
          controlsTopMarginX: '15px',
          controlsTopMarginY: '10px',
        },
        radii: {
          containerBorderRadius: '0px',
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Player
  title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
  playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
  theme={{
    borderStyles: {
      containerBorderStyle: 'hidden',
    },
    colors: {
      accent: '#00a55f',
    },
    space: {
      controlsBottomMarginX: '10px',
      controlsBottomMarginY: '5px',
      controlsTopMarginX: '15px',
      controlsTopMarginY: '10px',
    },
    radii: {
      containerBorderRadius: '0px',
    },
  }}
/>

### children

Overrides the custom controls for the Player. The below example removes the fullscreen button, adds a PiP button, and the volume
slider (so volume is only 0% or 100%). See the
[`Player` default controls](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer.js/blob/main/packages/react/src/components/media/Player.tsx)
for more details on how the `ControlsContainer` component is used.

```tsx {29-41}
import {
  ControlsContainer,
  PictureInPictureButton,
  PlayButton,
  Player,
  Poster,
  Progress,
  TimeDisplay,
  Title,
  Volume,
} from '@livepeer/react';

import Image from 'next/image';

import blenderPoster from '../../../public/images/blender-poster-2.png';

const PosterImage = () => {
  return <Image src={blenderPoster} layout="fill" objectFit="cover" />;
};

const title = 'Agent 327: Operation Barbershop';

export const CustomControlsPlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title={title}
      playbackId="bafybeida3w2w7fch2fy6rfvfttqamlcyxgd3ddbf4u25n7fxzvyvcaegxy"
    >
      <ControlsContainer
        poster={<Poster content={<PosterImage />} title={title} />}
        top={<Title content={title} />}
        middle={<Progress />}
        left={
          <>
            <PlayButton />
            <Volume showSlider={false} />
            <TimeDisplay />
          </>
        }
        right={<PictureInPictureButton />}
      />
    </Player>
  );
};
```

<CustomControlsPlayer />

## SSR

### Next.js

The Player also comes with a [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr) prefetch query, `prefetchPlayer`,
which makes it easy to prefetch the data used internally for the Player during server-side rendering.

First, you add a [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) function to the page which
you want to prefetch data on. The props should match the Player props to ensure that the correct data is prefetched.

```tsx
// pages/demo.tsx
import { prefetchPlayer, studioProvider } from '@livepeer/react';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const dehydratedState = await prefetchPlayer(
    { playbackId },
    { provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: 'yourStudioApiKey' }) },
  );

  return {
    props: {
      dehydratedState,
    },
    revalidate: 600,
  };
};
```

We need to update the `_app.tsx` to pass the `dehydratedState` in `pageProps` to the LivepeerConfig. We also move the
`livepeerClient` into a useMemo hook so that a new client is created on each request.

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import {
  LivepeerConfig,
  createReactClient,
  studioProvider,
} from '@livepeer/react';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

import { useMemo } from 'react';

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{ dehydratedState: string }>) {
  // we create a new livepeer client on each request so data is
  // not shared between users
  const livepeerClient = useMemo(
    () =>
      createReactClient({
        provider: studioProvider({
          apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_API_KEY,
        }),
      }),
    [],
  );

  return (
    <LivepeerConfig
      dehydratedState={pageProps?.dehydratedState}
      client={livepeerClient}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

That's it! You now have data prefetching on the server, which is passed to the browser and used to hydrate the initial query client.

### Other Frameworks

The process is very similar for other frameworks, with the exception that there is a `clearClient` boolean which should be used
to ensure that the client cache is not reused across users.

```tsx {7}
import { prefetchPlayer, studioProvider } from '@livepeer/react';

export const handleRequest = async (req, res) => {
  const dehydratedState = await prefetchPlayer(
    {
      playbackId,
      clearClient: true,
    },
    { provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: 'yourStudioApiKey' }) },
  );

  // sanitize the custom SSR generated data
  // https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0

  res.send(`
    <html>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
        <script>
          window.__REACT_QUERY_STATE__ = ${yourSanitizedDehydratedState};
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
};
```
