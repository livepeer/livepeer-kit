# useMetrics

Hook for retrieving metrics for a playback ID.

```tsx
import { useMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';
```

## Usage

The following examples assume a playback ID has been created for an Asset or Stream, and the [`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer)
is used for playback (with its built-in metrics reporting).

```tsx
import { useMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useMetrics(playbackId);
}
```

If a falsy playback ID is provided, the query will be skipped.

## Return Value

The return value is partially based on [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/useQuery), with some return types
aggregated for simplicity.

```tsx
{
  data?: Metrics,
  error?: Error,
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error',
  isError: boolean,
  isFetched: boolean,
  isFetching: boolean,
  isIdle: boolean,
  isLoading: boolean,
  isRefetching: boolean,
  isSuccess: boolean,
  refetch: (options: RefetchOptions) => Promise<UseQueryResult>,
}
```

## Configuration

### playbackId

Playback identifier. Can also be a string passed as the only parameter.

```tsx {5}
import { useMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useMetrics({
    playbackId,
  });
}
```

### UseQueryOptions

The `useMetrics` hook also supports any [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/useQuery) `useQuery` options, such as
`refetchInterval` or `enabled`. These override any configs passed by default by the internal hook.

```tsx {6}
import { useMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useMetrics({
    playbackId,
    refetchInterval: 30000,
  });
}
```
