# useAssetMetrics

Hook for retrieving metrics for an Asset.

```tsx
import { useAssetMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';
```

<Callout>
  Metrics are currently only available if a user has the ID associated with an
  Asset. This should only be the user(s) with write access to the asset -
  viewers are not able to use this hook.
</Callout>

## Usage

The following examples assume an ID has been created for an Asset, and the [`VideoPlayer`](/docs/VideoPlayer)
is used for playback (with its built-in metrics reporting).

```tsx
import { useAssetMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useAssetMetrics({ assetId });
}
```

If a falsy Asset ID is provided, the query will be skipped.

## Return Value

The return value is partially based on [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/useQuery), with some return types
aggregated for simplicity.

```tsx
{
  data?: Metrics,
  error?: Error,
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error',
  isError: boolean,
  isFetched: boolean,
  isFetching: boolean,
  isIdle: boolean,
  isLoading: boolean,
  isRefetching: boolean,
  isSuccess: boolean,
  refetch: (options: RefetchOptions) => Promise<UseQueryResult>,
}
```

## Configuration

### assetId

Asset identifier.

```tsx {5}
import { useAssetMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useAssetMetrics({
    assetId,
  });
}
```

### UseQueryOptions

The `useAssetMetrics` hook also supports any [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/useQuery) `useQuery` options, such as
`refetchInterval` or `enabled`. These override any configs passed by default by the internal hook.

```tsx {6}
import { useAssetMetrics } from '@livepeer/react';

function App() {
  const { data: metrics } = useAssetMetrics({
    assetId,
    refetchInterval: 30000,
  });
}
```
