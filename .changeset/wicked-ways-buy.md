**Feature:** added MP4 rendition prioritization to the React and React Native Player.

This is for support of MP4 renditions returned from `playbackInfo` from the Studio provider. If an MP4 rendition exists for an Asset, it will be prioritized over HLS, since this has been introduced as a performance improvement over HLS for short-form video.

The MP4 renditions will be chosen with the following algorithm: the device screen width and multiplied by a static multiplier (currently set to x2.5). This value is then compared to the rendition widths, and the renditions are prioritized based on the distance between these values. This results in a choice of a rendition which is close to the screen size without visual quality issues. For instance, a device with a 1280 pixel width would compute `1280px * 2.5 = 3200px`, and then sort the MP4 renditions by which are closest to this value.
