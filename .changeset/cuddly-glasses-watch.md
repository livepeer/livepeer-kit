**Feature:** added the ability to autoplay videos without forcing mute. This works only in certain conditions where the site is considered "trusted" and the user has interacted with the site - see [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/) and [Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/) docs for further details on when this is allowed. We recommend testing on your site to ensure that the media will autoplay under the conditions that you expect the user to engage with your content.
